# Cookie clicker
An automated game using selenium in python. You can check out the original game at http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/. Using selenium the python script automatically clicks the cookie thus increasing the score. Furthermore every 5 seconds, the script checks for the most expensive level-up available in the game and buys it if possible.
